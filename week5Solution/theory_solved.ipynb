Now consider the dichotomy that contains all points on the boundary of the bounding box but none of the points inside. That dichotomy is impossible if the box $B$ has a point in its interior. Finally, if all 5 points lie on the boundary of the bounding box, there are two that lie on the same side of the bounding box. Any dichotomy involving all but one of those two is impossible.\r\n",

    "Given a dichotomy $y \\in \\{-1,+1\\}^{d+1}$, we pick the hypothesis $w$ such that $w_1 = 0.1y_1$ and $w_i = y_i$ for $i>1$. Observe that for the first row of $X$ (data item $x_1$), we have $w^\\intercal x_1 = w_1 = 0.1 y_1$, hence $\\textrm{sign}(w^\\intercal x_1) = y_1$. For $i>1$, notice that $w^\\intercal x_i = w_1 + w_i = 0.1y_1 + y_i$. Since $y_1$ is multiplied by the factor $0.1$, we still have $\\textrm{sign}(w^\\intercal x_i) = y_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a cute solution from Nikolai (unfortunately I don't know his last name) from the math group. Nikolai observed that the matrix $X$ is invertable (I find this fact rather obvious. But one can easily show that in any linear combination of 0, the linear factor of the first column must be zero, and after that the remaning columns form an orthogonal basis, meaning the trivial linear combination is the only one). After that, we merely set $w=X^{-1}y$ for an arbitrary dichotomy encoded by $y$. Hence $Xw = XX^{-1}y= y$. Very clean and elegant, in my opinion, and Nikolai's solution deserves some attention. -Chris\n",
